Opt with differently configured var-inputs:

    - Not sure that my plan for Opt is adequate.

    - Current notes for Opt attributes are centered on the common use cases
      where all var-inputs (positionals or parameters) have the same
      configuration.

    - Consider even a simple case:

        --point <x> <y> [<z>]

    - How will that be modeled as classes and attributes?

Reorientation:

    - Editing pass over notes.txt:

        __HERE__

        - Edit to conform to new specification.
        - Add 'Summary' at the top of section, where applicable.
        - Collect:
            - Questions/doubts
            - Examples
            - Terminology
            - Road map items

    - questions-outstanding :
        - Make decisions.

specification: Specification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------
spec-syntax: Spec syntax
--------

Spec:

    - A spec is 0+ sections.

        [section...]

Section:

    - The first section:

        [title ::]                    # Default title: 'Usage'
        [variant...]                  # Allowed only in first section.
        [opt-spec | block-quote]...

    - Other sections:

        title ::                      # Required
        [opt-spec | block-quote]...

Variant:

    [name :] variant-spec             # Regular
    name! : variant-spec              # Partial

Variant-spec:

    - Options:

        -f             # Short.
        --foo          # Long.
        -abc           # Bundled flags: -a -b -c.

    - Positionals and parameters:

        <bar>          # Positional.
        -f <fubb>      # Parameter.

    - Quoted literals:

        `hello`        # Can be positional, positional-choice, parameter-choice.

    - Groups and alternatives:

        ()             # Group.
        []             # Group, optional.
        foo=()         # Named group.
        foo=[]         # Named group, optional.
        |              # Alternatives separator.

    - Quantifiers:

        ...            # 1 or more
        {m,n}          # Repetition: m through n, inclusive.
        ?              # Non-greedy for preceding quantifier.

    - Partial:

        foo!           # Insert foo partial into the variant.

Opt-spec:

    - Syntax:

        <pos>                  [: [help-text]]
        [opt-mention...] --opt [: [help-text]]

    - Explanation:

        - A <pos> defines one positional argument (ie, positional-spec),
          optionally with a quantifer.

        - An --opt consists of an opt-mention (eg --foo), optionally
          with a quantifer and 1+ parameter-specs.

    - An opt-spec uses a subset of variant-spec grammar. The following
      are not supported:

        - Variants.
        - Partials.
        - Named groups.

Opt-mention:

    - An opt-mention is just the Opt.name, with appropriate punctuation:

        <foo> | Positional.
        --bar | Long option.
        -b    | Short option.

Var-input:

    - Variable input provided by the user.
    - See positional-spec and parameter-spec for details.
    - Primarily an internal term, not user-facing.

Positional-spec:

    - Syntax:

        <foo>         | Positional
        <foo=choices> | With choices
        <foo=choice>  | Specific choice (in context of a variant-spec).

Parameter-spec:

    - Syntax:

        --foo <bar>         | Usage displays <bar>.
        --foo <bar=choices> | Usage displays <bar>, not <choices>.
        --foo <bar=choice>  | Specific choice (in context of variant-spec).

        --foo <choices>     | Usage displays choices.
        --foo <=choice>     | Specific choice (in context of variant-spec).

Choices:

    - Consists of 1+ choice, which can be:

        - Simple name consisting of \w or hyphen.
        - Quoted-literal.

Block-quotes and literals:

    - A section can contain literal text intersperced among the variant-specs
      and opt-specs.

    - Quoting:

        Situation            | Quote
        ----------------------------
        Block quote          | ```
        Inline quote         | `
        Literal backquote    | \`

    - Notes:

        - To suppress wrapping: append ! to the opening triple-quote.

        - Tripple-quotes can sit on their own line, or not.

Whitespace rules:

    - Line and indentation requirements:

        - Opt-spec must start on its own line.

        - Variant must start on its own line.

        - Opt-spec and variant continuation line must be indented more than the
          first line and be contiguous with it.

        - Section title must be on its own line, ending in marker.

    - Line breaks not allowed:

        - Within an {m,n} quantifier.

        - Between a name and equal sign.

        - Within a var-input.

    - Whitespace not allowed:

        - Between option prefix and its dest.

        - Between partial name and its exclamation mark.

        - Within a triple-dot quantifier.

    - This is a non-standard command line program: its grammar consists of one
      or more subcommands with a literal separator between them.

    API:

        - Parsing:

            Parser(spec = None, grammar = None, ...)

                - The spec/grammar arguments are mutex and optional.
                - Other arguments are deferred.

            parse(args = None, mode = ...) -> Result or raise

                - Parser can have a mode.
                - And parse() can temporarily use a different mode.

        - Querying and configuring grammar elements:

            query(*paths, **kws) -> Grammar.query(...) -> Query

                - Query paths are based on Opt.dest, Variant.name, and
                  Group.dest or Group.index. [What about Opt.name?]

                - The vast majority of queries will be for Opts:

                    query('foo', 'bar')

                    - Gets Opt(foo) and Opt(bar).

                    - More precisely, the query gets any grammar element having
                      those dests/names.

                - In complex cases where independent Opts have the same dest,
                  the query path can include the variant name.

                    query('go foo')

                    - Gets Opt(foo) inside Variant(go).

                - Although Groups can have a dest, most won't. But they will
                  have a unique index within each variant.

                    query('go 2')

                    - Gets the third Group in Variant(go).

                - As a future enhancement, these query path elements can be
                  interpreted as regular expressions (I doubt the need).

            config(*paths, **kws) -> None

                - Given Opts, configure them all in the same way.

                - Just a shortcut for query(*paths).config(**kws).

            config_each(attr_name, d) -> None

                - Given Opts, set one attribute in different ways
                  for each opt.

                - The second argument is a dict mapping query paths to the
                  desired value for the attribute.

                - For example, setting a bunch of Opt.text values:

                    config_each('text', dict(
                        foo = 'Blah',
                        bar = 'Blah blah',
                    ))

        - Obtaining help text or text for the error from most recent parse():

            help_text(section...)
            error_text
            exception

        - Actions like printing or exiting.

            warn(msg)
            help(section...)
            error(msg = None, code = 1)
            exit(msg = None, code = 0)

Section

    - Used to create labeled groups of Opt for help text purposes.
    - Each variant has a corresponding section with the same name. [???]

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    name      | Short symbolic name used in API.
    label     | Used in help text.
    opts      | Opts belonging to the section.

Opt:

    - A configurable data object to represent one option (with parameters,
      quantifiers) or one positional (with quantifiers).

    Attribute | Note

    nargs     | .
    nparams   | .
    name      | Symbolic name(s) for variable-input (positional or parameter).

    help      | Defer. For help dispatching. Maybe handle via dispatch attribute.
    convert   | Defer. Callable.
    validate  | Defer. Callable.
    hide      | Defer. False (visible), True (hidden), or sequence of where/what to hide

    arg_names | Internal. Seems related to simple spec parsing.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For options taking multiple parameters or positionals having multiple
    arguments, the most common use case treats the parameters/arguments as
    values of the same kind -- meaning that that have the same type, defaults,
    choices, conversion, validation, etc. However, sometimes users want those
    characteristics to vary. In that case, the following attributes also
    support a sequence of values, one per parameter/argument. In cases where
    the nparams/nargs have no upper bound, the last value in the sequence will
    be applied: for example, if nparams=(2,None) one could use convert=(float,
    int), which would use int to convert any parameters beyond the second.

        dest      # Needed only for parameters.
        metavar

        default
        factory
        value
        ----
        choices
        convert
        validate

    API:

Result:

    - Data object returned to end-user by Parser.parse().

questions-outstanding: Questions outstanding
--------

** This section has:
    - Questions outstanding.
    - Notes that need to be edited and put in the appropriate spot.

opt-independence and parsed-data-structure :
    - edit sections to reflect new policy.

Did user supply a value or did it come from the configured default?

    - After parsing occurs, how does the user tell if an opts attribute was
      (1) supplied in the command-line args vs (2) obtain from the default.

    - This an annoying problem with no good argparse solutions.

    - I dealt with the issue in mvs.

Merging user-preferences and opts.

    - I dealt with the issue in mvs.

    - User-prefs and opts tend to have the same validation needs.

    - And the merge them can be tricky.

        - Maybe this isn't too bad if we could solve the argparse
          deficiency where you don't know if the opt was supplied or was
          the default.

        - If we knew that, then the merge logic would be simpler[?].

            for K, V in prefs.items():
                if opts.K was not set by user:
                    opts.K = V

How does a user request a non-default location for user-prefs?
    - Environment variable.

Ability to report rank-order positions of opts on command-line.
    - Example use cases:
        - Perl `rename`: the "rules" has to be applied in order.
        - Unix `find`: ditto.

Variant: other notes:

    - Opts can be configured in a variant-spec, or the user
      can use an abbreviated form (an opt-mention vs opt-spec).

    - The two types of configuration (variants and opt-specs) are additve.

    - Subsuequent configurations never overwrite a prior settings for an Opt.
      Each new setting is added to the prior settings.

Section content:

        - variant-scope lines. Looks the same as as partial usage.
          Subsequent opt-spec lines will be scoped to that variant.
          Applicable only when Opt.dest values are reused across variants.

            * Clarifications and questions:
            - Here's how I a variant-scope line:

                Foo ::

                grep!

                [-b --bar] : Blah blah

            - Is this concept necessary?
            - Probably not. It's an unusual use case.
            - Even if it were, I suspect that this solution is inadequate.
            - To fully support this level of fine-tuning, you might need
              a sym-dest to include some kind of scoping syntax.

Indentation:

    - Optopus will generally try to preserve the original indentation
      level of ordinary text -- specifically the indentation of the
      first line of the paragraph.

    - If line-wrapping is suppressed, Optopus will rendered lines
      as-is, including each line's indentation.

Names:

    - Various grammar elements have names or name-like attributes:

        - Variant: name.
        - Partial: name.
        - Opt:
            - dest is the "name" for Parser and programmer.
            - sym is the name in the help-text.

    - Optopus allows both typical names and non-standard ones (eg, names
      starting with underscore or even digit).

    - However, the name/dest will be normalized as follows:

        - Hyphens converted to underscores.
        - Attach underscore prefix to name/dest starting with digit.

--------
api-vs-text: API-driven vs text-driven
--------

Two fundamental configuration strategies for argument parsers:

    - API-driven:

        - User configures a parser via the programmatic API.
        - The parser generates the help text.
        - Typically allows user to override with literal help text, if desired.
        - Examples: argparse and many others.

    - Text-driven:

        - User writes usage and options text.
        - Library derives the parser from that text.
        - This approach is much less common.
        - Examples: docopt.

The optopus library combines the best of both approaches:

    - API-driven.

        - Tends to require less typing.

        - Generated usage text is mostly fine, especially for simpler projects.

        - Most developers probably prefer an API-driven approach over
          hand-formatting help text themselves.

        - API-generated help text will follow the conventions for documenting
          command-line programs -- conventions that few developers have studied
          in depth and would rather not worry about.

    - Text-driven for grammar and naming:

        - Even though my experiments configuring argument parsers of varying
          complexity via usage text convinced me of the benefits of an
          API-driven approach, text-driven option parsers have notable
          advantages. Those advantages are focused on command-line grammar and
          the associated naming for parsed data returned to the caller.

        - The text-driven approach emphasizes the idea of usage variants, a
          technique that can greatly enhance usage-text readability --
          especially for complex programs but also for small ones.

                git diff [<commit>] [--] [<path>...]
                git diff --cached [<commit>] [--] [<path>...]
                git diff <commit> <commit> [--] [<path>...]

                frob [--debug] [--foo <f>] <path>...
                frob --help
                frob --version

        - Usage variants open up a range of possibilities in the kinds of
          command-line grammars that can be supported. API-driven parsers
          struggle with command-lines that need any grammar falling beyond the
          most typical cases. On stackoverflow and bugs.python.org, for
          example, one can find many command-line use cases (some of them quite
          simple) that are not supported easily by argparse but that are
          straightforward in docopt.

        - Finally, usage syntax is both efficient and intuitive. When internet
          users discuss command-line grammar scenarios, they invariably use a
          usage syntax to specify the desired grammar. In my own research, I
          experimented with defining the needed grammars via an API, but I
          consistently found the text-based approach simpler to express and
          read. [For a good example, see this argparse discussion where a user
          describes a problem in general terms and suggests how the argparse
          API could be augmented to handle such cases -- and the discussion
          both are somewhat difficult to understand without very careful
          reading and thinking. Then the user provides a short one-line usage
          syntax, and the issue is immediately clear.
          https://bugs.python.org/issue11588]

Configuration via usage syntax is focused on grammar:

    - Optopus keeps that syntax fairly clean, readable, and intutive by
      focusing it solely on the grammar and naming -- the area where it excels.
      Other details, if any are neeeded, are handled via the API.

    - The syntax is also intuitive because it relies heavily on common
      conventions for documenting command-line programs.

    - The syntax will look roughly like familiar usage text, plus a small
      number of additional syntax elements focused on supporting flexible
      command-line grammar.

          - Usage variants. Discussed above.

          - Partial variants, which use the variant concept to define a named
            group of options and/or arguments that can then be inserted into
            one or more usage variants -- avoiding repetition in the definition
            of complex grammars (argparse does this via parents).

          - Named destinations for any group of elements in the grammar.

    - The syntax opens up a wide range of possibilities for complex programs or
      unusual grammars

    - But it also helps at the micro scale, simplifying the configuration of
      individual options.

--------
other-lib-weaknesses: Addressing weaknesses common in other libraries
--------

Providing users with simple ways to handle command-line grammars and usage
variants (just noted).

Supporting everything from quick-and-dirty scripts to complex, highly
customized command-line programs:

    - At once extreme, optopus allows you to parse any default-behavior
      command line, with zero configuration. Just import and go. This parser
      won't enforce any rules, but it will tell you what the end-user entered
      -- which is good enough for many types of quick-and-dirty scripts,
      debugging sessions, experiments, and even early prototypes.

            import optopus
            opts = optopus.parse_args()

    - At the other extreme, you could build the next Git or a variety of
      programs with idiosyncratic grammars, heavily customized help text, and
      many other features.

    - Sitting between the two extremes are numerous conveniences and sensible
      defaults to make option parsing easy, no matter what level of control
      your application needs.

Allowing users to control the generated help text in a fine-grained manner.

    - Program complexity increases the need to organize and fine-tune help
      text, but not necessarily to write and layout the whole thing
      (text-driven libraries require that).

    - Optopus provides many mechanisms for that fine tuning:

        - Simple top-level configurations to control basic layout,
          capitalization, punctuation, etc.

        - Ability to group options into sections.

        - Ability to supply hand-crafted sections whenever needed and to locate
          those sections with precision in the output.

        - Ability to control nearly all parameters driving the help text
          contruction process via configuration and, where necessary, through
          the programmatic hooks. There should be no need to subclass optopus
          or delve into the parser's innards.

        - Support for common styles: command-line vs man-page.

Allowing users to enhance usage-text readability by being able to refer to
groups of options and to omit either short or long options.

    - API-generated usage text tends to be poor not only because it lacks usage
      variants but also because the generated text exhaustively lists all
      options in all of their permutations (short and long).

    - Especially as the number of options grows, readability can be improved
      greatly by referring to sets of options by symbolic names rather than by
      enumerating every possibility.

    - Similarly, readability can be enhanced by focusing the usage text on just
      the long-options (or just the short-options) and then providing a mapping
      between short and long options latter in the help text.

Allowing users to define their arguments and options in ways that encourage
modularity.

    - In optopus a user defines/configures options and arguments as atomic
      units, separate from the issues of command-line grammar, usage variants,
      and options help text.

    - Each of those atomic units can be attached to one or more groups of
      related options.

    - Then those options or option-groups can be leveraged when defining the
      command-line grammar, when expressing the generated usage text, and when
      organizing the options text into sections.

Providing users with full access to the parser configuration, both via the API
and in the form of standard, serializable data structures.

Providing users more conventient mechanisms to reduce repetition in
the configuration of the parser.

--------
other-goals: Other goals
--------

Prioritize the simple use cases. Yes, add features and customization
capability. But do that without sacrificing super super usage patterns.

Usage should be intuitive and declarative, especially for the simplest and most
common use cases. It should not depend on bizarre syntax or on user-created
complex data structures.

The parser's configuration should be expressible as a data structure -- and
creatable from one. This is important for testing, debugging, easy integration
with config files, and using other libraries for data validation.

For complex programs or special needs, users should have full control over
documentation. This includes both usage/help text and the styling of error
messages.

Easy system for validators to be combined flexibly.

Should easily support different help types: (a) brief usage/synopsis, (b) full
help or man-page, and (c) extras or examples. Regarding the latter, provide
utility functions to format/wrap any text blob in the same manner that Optopus
would format official sections in the help text: p.format(BLOB) should return
text consistent with the look and behavior of other help text, based on Parser
defaults and configuration.

Include ability to merge options from several sources: ENV variables, config
files, command-line options. Note that the purpose of the configuration sources
(ENV vars and config files) is to set the default values used by the
command-line option parser. When defaults are supplied, it should also cause a
required option to become non-required (in other words, whenever default is set
for an option, it causes required to become False.

Make it easy to test the option parser.

Error handling should be under the user's control, if they want it. This is a
serious flaw in some parsers (eg argparse). The library should support both
"automatic" mode (where the parser will eagerly print help or error message and
then exit) or non-automatic mode (where the parser will simply return an object
containing all information and allow the user to decide what to do. [Note that
argparse has addressed this, in whole or in part, in Python 3.9].

Should have a design that is friendly to customization. Allow users to
customize by writing simple functions or hooks rather than having to subclass.
Consider using the pluggy library so that users can implement simple function
hooks.

Start simple: begin with core behaviors; don't support more flexibility until a
basic working system is in place.

Where possible, rely on convention over configuration: sensible defaults to
allow the most common path to be followed with minimal setup.

Provide good support for --version. Show the application's name and version
number.

Provide helper functions for warn(), exit().

Support various configuration styles: per option configuration (argparse and
many other libraries do this); and thematic or bulk (make one type of setting
on multiple options at once).

Allow the user to have hidden options (eg for developers only).

Support file and dir types as arguments, with checks for existence or non-existence.

For file path arguments, support the ability to treat `-` as stdin or stdout.

Support an easy way to get bash completion.

Support @somefile.txt: user supplies command-line args via a file.

Support parse_known_args().

Support abbreviated option names when there is no ambiguity.

Support some no-configuration argument parsing strategies: default (options are
flags), key-val (options take single args by default), greedy (options consume
as many params as possible).

Support conversion/validation.

Support dispatch mechanisms.

The parser's configuration is likely to be organized as a fairly deep tree
behind the scenes. But make it easy for the user to query that tree to obtain
nodes of interest for configuration and other purposes. Primarily this means
quickly getting Opt instances, but there could be other types of interest as
well.

Let users control the important aspects of the help text: section ordering;
section titles; layout style (eg, compact 2-column or man-page); capitalization
rules; widths; conventions for showing default values; etc.

--------
standard-cli-grammar: Standard command-line grammar
--------

Typical rules of command-line grammar, as commonly understood in Unix tradition:

    - Options start with a prefix:

        --long
        -s

    - Options can take zero or more ordered parameters.

    - Positional arguments are ordered among each other:

        P1 P2 P3 ...

    - Options can be ordered in any way:

        --x4 --x1 --x3 --x2 ...

    - Options can be freely interspersed among the ordered positional arguments.

        --x3 P1 --x1 --x4 P2 --x2 P3 ...

    - Short options can be bundled:

        -x -y -z
        -xyz

--------
cli-grammar-vs-regex: Command-line grammar vs. regex
--------

Although Optopus usage syntax borrows many concepts from regular expressions,
command-line grammar parsing is not readily amenable to handling via regex
parsing approaches.

Positionals are ordered among themselves, but options can appear in any order
(ignoring boundaries and anchors). That flexibility makes it not very intuitive
to convert a command-line grammar into a manageable regular expression. At
every stage, any of the options are possible. But then once an option appears,
it cannot appear again (ignoring repeatables). That means command-line parsing
is context-sensitive.

--------
subparsers-not-needed: Optopus does not need the subparser concept
--------

The subparser concept is much less powerful and flexible than the key concept
of a command-line grammar, along with the related ideas of usage variants and
flexible destination assignment. It's also less intuitive.

The universe of command-line programs could be broken down into a sizable
majority and two small minorities:

    - A sizable majority that needs neither subparsers nor a complex grammar.

    - A small minority that align conceptually with the subparser concept. But
      command-line grammar supports this use case even better.

    - A small minority that are forced by the limitations of current argument
      parsing libraries to resort to subparsers even though the concept does
      not align very well with their needs.

--------
opt-action-not-needed: Optopus does not need the action concept
--------

Arguments can be configured in argparse with an 'action' parameter. The
parameter is a bit overloaded and misleading. It does control some actions (eg,
showing help text), but mostly it is used as a sometimes misnamed device for option type
and destination assignment.

    Action       | Option type       | Example         | Stored      | Notes
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    store_true   | 1 flag            | --frob          | True (N=1)  | .
    store_false  | 1 flag            | --frob          | False       | To override a True default
    count        | 1+ flags          | -v -v           | N           | .
    store        | Single            | --foo F         | F           | .
    append       | Repeatable single | -x A -x B       | [A, B]      | Overwrite on repeat
    extend       | Repeatable multi  | -x A B -x C D E | [A B C D E] | .
    help         | High precedence   | .               |             | .
    version      | "    "            | .               | .           | .
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    store_const  | 1 flag            | --frob          | X           | Not necessary
    append_const | 1+ flag           | --frob --frob   | [X x]       | Not necessary

Notes:

    - To achieve argparse store_false:
        - The generalized case is a flag that stores some constant.
        - Default constant is True.
        - But user can define a convert function to store anything else.

    - Data storage to achieve argparse extend:
        - See parsed-data-structure

--------
explicit-option-param-syntax: Why explicit syntax for option parameters is needed
--------

Imagine that the grammar did not require explicit surrouding markers for
parameters, positionals, and literal values: {}, <>, and ''. Every type of
confusion would be possible.

    frob --type x y z   # Meaning of x, y, z unclear.

Some ways to address that problem:

    - Minimize syntax burden. Require that literals be quoted (because rarely
      needed) and positionals use angle brackets (because it is conventional).

    - Enforce consistency: require all 3 types of markers (and because braces
      for params are also conventional).

    - Be creative: require that literals be quoted and give users a mechanism
      to disambiguate when needed. Probably a bad idea: these issues can be
      tricky to think through. Also, for non-standard grammars, a small bit of
      extra typing seems easy compared to having to reason about subleties.

--------
variable-input-spec: Spec for variable input
--------

The initial spec-syntax handled variable input like this:

    - Approach #1: incorrect.

        <dest>       | Positional
        --dest <sym> | Option with parameter

Then I switched to the following:

    - A spec is represents the ultimate help-text.
    - Thus, names in the spec are better understood as syms, not dests.
    - A positional defaults to having the same name for its sym and dest.

    - Approach #2: also incorrect.

        <sym>        | Positional
        --dest <sym> | Option with parameter

But now I think the spec is symbolic names all the way down:

    - An option (formerly modeled as --dest) is just a thing with a symbolic
      name (--sym). And since everything is a syn/name, just use natural
      language (--name).

    - Approach #3:

        - Abstract (unlikely to ever be documented this way).

            <name>        | Positional
            --name <name> | Option with parameter

        - More intuitive description of the policy.

            <foo>        | Positional, with Opt.name=foo
            --bar <fubb> | Option, with Opt.name=bar and having Parameter.name=fubb

    - How this approach works with all entities having names:

        - Symbolic names in help-text:
            - Opt
            - Parameter

        - Symbolic name in the spec/API:
            - Section
            - Variant

For a while, I considered a more elaborate var-input-spec that allowed the user
to configure sym and dest independently.

    - But it's not worth it.
    - The most common use is with plural nargs/nparams:
        - Plural dest (eg paths).
        - Singular sym (path).
    - But this is more naturally configured via the API.

    # Too complex.
    <dest.sym>           | Positional
    --dest <subdest.sym> | Option with parameter

    - In addition, the subdest concept is unneeded:
        - The purpose is to package up the positional/parameter values
          up into a different, object-like data structure.
        - The appropriate solution here is a user-provided convert function.

--------
high-precendence-options: High precedence options
--------

Most options control the primary behaviors of a program. But some are special,
most notably those related to user help:

    --help
    --version
    --examples
    --demo

Argument parsing libraries often provide a convenient mechanism for --help and
sometimes --version, but rarely anything else. In addition, they tend to
provide such features in a way that is slightly misleading (at least in a
strict sense) and definitely not as convenient for users as it could be.

Consider a simple subcommand-style program. Assume that both <id> and the
parameter for -n should be integers and that the program has both general help
text and subcommand help text.

    demo [--help] [-n {}] (print|delete) <id>

At least by default, if the end-user supplies the --help option, an argument
parser should (1) print help text and exit, (2) select the help text that is
relevant given the other command-line arguments, and (3) ignore errors in the
other command-line arguments. Some examples of desired behavior:

    demo --help                # General help.
    demo --help delete         # Delete help.
    demo --help -n HI delete   # Same, in spite of invalid -n parameter.

Most argument parsers fail on #3 (they gripe instead of helping) and they do
not easily support #2.

Optopus addresses those problems with two mechanisms: high-precendence options
and flexible dispatching. If an option is configured to be high-precendence,
its presence among the command-line arguments will trigger whatever action it
has been configured to perform, and that dispatching configuration will take
precendence over error reporting. When high-precendence options are used, the
parser performs a best-effort parsing to collect as much contextual information
as it can before calling the code responsible taking action.

There are limits, of course. Some types of bad input can reduce the accuracy of
that best-effort parse. In this example, -Q in an unknown option and is treated
by default as a flag taking no parameters, which then means that HI is is
interpretted an invalid subcommand.

    demo --help -Q HI delete   # General help rather than delete help.

--------
help-text-formatting: Help text formatting
--------

Text wrapping:

    - Respect terminal widths, if known and within boundaries:

        min_width = 40
        max_width = 100

    - Allow users to adjust those parameters.

    - User-supplied text:

        - Break into paragraphs (but preserve info about N of blank lines
          between paragraphs).

        - Rewrap to the desired width (probably using textwrap module).

        - Leave indented paragraphs as-is. [This note is out of date.]

        - Provide an easy syntax for users to suppress line wrapping
          within the text (eg something borrowed from markdown)

Option parameters:

    - Avoid the typical verbosity of API-based help text. By default,
      use a compact notation for parameters:

        [--foo {}] [--bar {}] [--bazz {} {} {}]

    - Let users set their own defaults too:

        p = Parser()
        p.defaults(metavar = 'X')

--------
grammar-parsing-algo: Parsing the grammar syntax
--------

Phase 1: input normalization:

    - Accept text and/or lines of text.
    - Join into a block of text.

Phase 2: lexing:

    - Remember that the lexer analyzes character by character to emit
      a flat streem of the meaningful atomic units of the language.

    - It does not engage in validation logic to assess whether the arrangement
      of those units is syntactically valid.

    - Nor does it try to assemble those character-based atoms into fully
      meaningful entitities, other than in cases where they must be assembled
      to avoid ambiguity with similar tokens.

Phase 3: parsing:

    - A parser's job is to eat a stream of tokens, organizing them into
      meaningful and valid units, and emitting those units to the caller.

        - Previously, I tried to write the lexer code with a parsing mindset.
          That was too hard.

        - Now we just have to figure out how to organize the consumption of the
          tokens listed above.

    - Focus now on the full grammar. Convenience syntax can be handle later via
      a different subclass, different tokens, different handlers, or
      some combo.

    - Handlers should be substantive from the perspective of the
      language, not low level.

    - Because the tokens and handlers differs somewhat between the grammar
      section and other sections, the parsing needs to be stateful -- advancing
      to the section state at the first section-tile line after the grammar
      section.

Phase 4: assembly:

    - The parser phase is the most complex, so don't overburden it with the
      duty of creating the ultimate grammar elements.

    - Instead, keep the parser simpler by having it emit simple AST-style
      objects.

    - The last phase converts the AST to true grammar elements.

--------
convenience-parsing-algo: Parsing the convenience grammar syntax
--------

** This section might be out of date.

The grammar can be built from the parts we already have:

    P1         = positional | positional_definition
    P2         = [ P1 ]

    O1         = short_option | long_option
    O2         = parameter | parameter_definition
    O3         = [ O2 ]

    single_pos = P1+ P2*
    single_opt = O1 O2+ O3*

Apply extra validation at the end to disallow:

    Only a single Opt (if P1 repeats, they must have same dest).
    Group
    PositionalVariant
    ParameterVariant

To orchestrate things we can adjust the SpecParser initializer:

    def __init__(self, text, single = False):
        self.lexer = RegexLexer(text, GRAMMAR_TOKENS)
        if single:
            self.parser_functions = (self.single_pos, self.single_opt)
        else:
            self.parser_functions = (self.variant,)

--------
arg-parsing-algo: Parsing algorithm
--------

Notation and terminology:

    - Purely notational concepts:

        Pos:         A positional Opt.
        MGroup:      A Group having mutex=True.
        Alternative: A Variant or MGroup.
        OPT:         When current arg looks like an Opt.
        POS:         When current arg looks like a Pos.

    - Parsing terms:

        - Alternatives: the Variants and MGroups determine how many
          alternatives we will try.

        - Interpretations: within an alternative, there can be multiple valid
          interpretations of the arguments -- specifically how they are
          allocated to Opts either as positionals or params.

        - Backtracking terms:

            - Current interpretation or parsing route: the interpretation you
              are currently on, based on a successful parse of the current arg.

            - Foregone interpretation: the interpretation that you could have
              selected, but did not -- so you push it to the stack before proceeding
              with the current interpretation.

Some key insights related to backtracking:

    - Parsing decisions that might require backtracking come from positional
      arguments or parameters, not options. Options, if present, are
      non-ambiguous: either they are known and allowed, or not.

    - Backtracking is needed when your current parsing route ends up attaching
      a param to an Opt or an argument to a Pos but then that route ultimately
      fails (on a later argument). You need to backtrack to check any foregone
      alternative interpretations of the input arguments.

    - Alternative interpretations are possible only for Opt with non-static
      nparams, Pos with non-static nargs, or Pos with non-static ntimes.

    - So pushing to the stack needs to happen when your parsing decision for
      the current argument creates a foregone alternative.

    - This occurs only for successful parsing of the current argument; never
      for errors.

    - Variants and MGroups also don't require a backtracking mechanism.

        - Rather, you want to process all of the alternatives in order, based
          on the Grammar. Each alternative either succeeds or fails. And you
          stop on the first success.

        - The best time to load the stack with these alternatives is before the
          while-stack loop begins. This will ensure that each alternative will
          be tried in order. Because we are using a stack, backtracking within
          any specific alternative (due to non-static nparams/nargs) will
          finish before the algorithm advances to a fresh alternative.

        - If you were to try to push foregone interpretations to the stack when
          an alternative fails, you interfere with the correct ordering of the
          alternatives. Perhaps even worse, it's not easy to know within the
          while-stack loop when an alternative has totally failed. Each
          iteration of the loop can be either starting a fresh alternative or
          exploring one of the different interpretations possible within the
          alternative.

A backtracking example:

    Grammar:
        Opt('-f', nparams = (1,3))
        Opt('x', nargs = (3,4))

    Input:
        -f V1 V2 V3 V4 V5

    Parsing logic:

        -f : Valid: attach it to Opt(-f).

        V1 : Attach to Opt(-f)

        V2 : Because Opt(-f) is greedy by default, attach. But
             this attachment is not required due to non-static
             nparams. Before pushing the new State where V2
             is attached to Opt(-f), we should push the foregone
             interpretation -- namely, where we restrict Opt(-f)
             to nparams of (1,1).

        V3 : Same logic: attach and push foregone interpretation.

        V4 : Attach to Opt(x).

        V5 : Same.

        -  : Now we're out of arguments and have not
             satisfied Opt(x). So this interpretation fails.
             The next State in the stack will restrict
             Opt(-f) to nparams of (2,2), which will succeed.

    Logic if Opt(-f) had been non-greedy.

        V2 : Don't attach to Opt(-f). Now the foregone interpretation
             is for Opt(-f) with nparams of (2,3). Push that
             to the stack.

State:

    - Data object to hold parsing state as the various interpretations from the
      grammar are being tried during the while-stack loop.

    - Attributes:

        ai: index of args.

        next_pos: next available Pos [or None].

        nps: nparams remaining for the active Opt [or None].

        avail: map of available Opt to remaining ntimes [0 for exhausted].

        target: Target instance holding parsed data accumulated so far.

        err: error that terminated the current alterantive [or None].

        variant: name/id/index for the current variant; relevant for
        error selection/reporting, not parsing directly.

ArgResult:

    Data object to represent info need to capture the result-so-far
    for the parsing the current arg. Some likely attributes:

        err: data object holding error info
        opt: matched Opt
        val: converted value

    Notation used here:

        ArgResult(ERR: ...) | Current arg failed.
        ArgResult(OPT)      | Current arg matched OPT.
        ArgResult(PARAM)    | Current arg matched PARAM.
        ArgResult(POS)      | Current arg matched POS.
        ArgResult(UNKNOWN)  | For forge-ahead-mode or parse-known-mode.

How to handle Groups with non-static ntimes:

    - A Group can be optional overall (optional is one type of non-static), but
      have required elements if the Group is triggered by the presence of any
      of its elements. For example, if either -x or -y are present, both are
      needed.

        [ -x -y [-i] ]

    - When to handle such matters:

        - During parse. For example, when we see -x, then we would
          immediately adjust ntimes for -y.

        - After a successfull ArgResult. Before checking Opts for sufficient
          nparams, nargs, ntimes, we would first adjust those expectations
          based on any Groups that were activated by the presence of the Opts.

    - The latter, for two reasons:

        - Groups can alter quantifier expections. It makes sense to do all of
          that quantifier checking together.

        - More fundamentally, an optional Group can contain positionals and
          params. Like in the rest of the grammar, greedy is the default. That
          means positionals within optional Groups should be attached eagerly.
          It could get very messy trying to support some special logic just for
          optional Groups. The user has multiple ways to configure the grammar
          if the default greediness isn't desired.

Algorithm: setup:

    Stuff from the end-user or user:

        args = [...]

        P = Parser(...)

    Initialize the stack that drives the algorithm. For every allowed combo of
    Variant and MGroup, add a State instance to represent the initial
    conditions of each alternative.

        stack = list(reversed(stack))

                If either of these apply:

                    - Match Pos has non-static nargs or ntimes.
                Then:
                    S2 = new State to represent the foregone parsing route
                    stack.push(S2)

            # Store history.
            S.target.add(ares)
            history.append(S)

            # Create next parsing State.
            S1 = new State based on current parsing route
            stack.push(S1)

Algorithm: wrap up:

    if success:
        return history[-1].target

    else:
        - Examine history to find most relevant error.
        - Return or raise, depending on Parser configuration.

Post-parsing logic:

    target = self.do_parse(...)

    Load the data from target into a Result. Details will vary based on Parser
    configuration and parsing-mode.

--------
alternative-parsing-algo: Alternative parsing algorithm won't work after all
--------

The algorithm:

    - When parse() is called, there will be N command line arguments.
      Command-line use cases never have large N.

    - Using the parser configuration, assemble data on the aspects of the
      grammar that are not static. The most common non-static configurations:
      varying nargs, nparams, or ntimes; variants; and alternatives.

    - For grammar elements that have no inherent boundaries (eg, an option
      taking 1+ params), interpret them in as bounded by using N as the upper
      limit.

    - Use all of that information to generate all static grammars that satisfy
      the actual grammar.

    - Check each static grammar against the command line arguments.

    - A successful parse finds exactly one successful static grammar.

What causes a grammar to generate multiple possibilities?

    .                     | Where expressed | Note
    -----------------------------------------------------
    Varying nargs/nparams | Opt             | .
    Varying ntimes        | Opt or Phrase   | Includes required.
    Alternatives          | Phrase          | Includes variants.
    Aliases               | Opt             | .

Benefits of the algorithm:

    - This code seems easy to write:

        - The generation of static grammars seems like a manageable
          situation involving itertools.

        - Parsing a static grammar very simple: no backtracking required.

    - It provides a run-time guard for users against ambiguous grammars.

Three concerns:

    - The approach seems non-standard. A classic stack algorithm seems to suit
      the situation. And that code might not be any harder to write -- perhaps
      just a bit less familiar. Why reinvent the wheel? Make sure there's a
      good reason.

    - Modern operating systems and shells have very large limits on the max
      size of command lines and N of arguments. Why build a good argument
      parsing tool that would fail at moderate values for N -- especially
      when a linear algorithm is known?

    - There won't necessarily be only one successful parse of the static
      grammars, as noted in the discussion of ambiguous grammars. By using a
      greedy assignment policy the parser can ignore that matter. But regular
      expressions have a greedy concept precisely because without it there can
      be more than one successful parse of an input. [On further reflection,
      this point argues against expecting only one successful static grammar.
      But if you try the static grammars in the correct order, based on greedy
      policies in place, you can stop at the first success -- as regex does.]

--------
ambiguous-grammars: Ambiguous grammars are not an issue
--------

From a strictly grammatical perspective, only one positional can have a
non-static nargs or ntimes, because there isn't exactly one valid way to attach
the values to the destination attributes. A similar problem occurs when an
option has non-static nparams and a positional has non-static nargs.
Two examples:

    <xray>...    <y>...
    --xray {}... <y>...

But that's not a problem, because Optopus can do what regular expression
engines do: greedy assignment by default, non-greedy by configuration.

--------
opt-independence: Opt independence and duplicate names
--------

** Edit this section to reflect new policy:
    - Opts will be independent.
    - Do not condense/merge contiguous reuse of same Opt name.

The spec-syntax is flexible, so Optopus needs to know how to handle unusual
situations, including the repetition or reuse of the same sym/dest for
positionals, options, or parameters.

Several examples:

    - Contiguous repetition as a syntactic alternative for nargs/ntimes:

        <x> <x> [<x>]               # Contiguous; can be condensed.
        -x [-x]                     # Same.

        -x -y -x                    # Noncontiguous but condensable (option ordering irrelevant).
        <x> <yy> <x>                # Noncontiguous positionals.

    - Reuse across variants:

        foo : <x> [-y]              # Same configuration.
        bar : -z -y <x>

        foo : <x> [-y]              # Different configuration.
        bar : -z -y <x> <x>

        foo : <x> [-y]              # Different type.
        bar : -z -y [-x]

    - Reuse across alternatives:

        (-x -y | -a -x -z | -q)     # Same configuration.

        (<x=A|B> | <x> <x> <x>)     # Different configuration.
        (<x> | <x> <x> <x>)

        (-x | <x> <x>)              # Different type.

    - Reuse within an alternative:

        <x> (<x> <x>)...            # Different configuration.
        <x> <foo> <x>               # Different configuration (related to arg binding).

        -x <x> <x>                  # Different type.

        - Note: there are no examples here for "same configuration": contiguous
          will be condensed; noncontiguous positionals cannot have same
          configuration (arg binding); and noncontiguous options will be
          condensed.

    - Reuse for separator-based grammars: nab:

        - The nab use case illustrates why Opt independence within the same
          variant is sometimes needed (for a while I had considered disallowing
          reuse within variants).

        - A separator-based grammar needs a single main grammar where all of
          the subcommands can be used in sequence (including repetitions).
          But subcommands are often likely to need Opts with the same dest.

        chomp!   : / <cmd=chomp>
        findall! : / <cmd=findall> <rgx> [-a]
        grep!    : / <cmd=grep> <rgx> [-i] [-v] [-s]
        range!   : / <cmd=range> <start> <stop> [<step>] [-g]
        run!     : / <cmd=run> <code> [-g <>] [-a] [-v] [-i]

        main : [--debug] commands=(chomp! | grep! | range! | run!)...
        help : --help

Opt independence vs unity has possible ramifications in several areas:

    - Spec parsing.
    - Grammar creation.
    - Grammar configuration.
    - Argument parsing.
    - Result creation.
    - Usage text creation.
    - Opt-spec lines creation.

Policy decisions:

    - During spec parsing, contiguous repetitions of the same dest will be
      condensed when possible. Otherwise, independent Opts will be created.

        - I have doubts about this now.
        - Condensing loses information -- namely, about how the user wants the
          usage text to look.

    - A Grammar is just a list of elements, either Groups or Opts (and a Group
      has the same structure). The dest is not used as an unique identifier, so
      no problems are caused by repetition.

    - During configuration, the user can query for Opts flexibly. If they
      define a weird spec that makes it inconvenient to query for Opts
      individually, they can easily adjust by defining things like Variant.name
      or Group.dest to disambiguate. Worst case, they can query using Group/Opt
      indexes (rather than dests) or just query for several Opts and then
      examine their details to select the one needed for configuration.

    - Argument parsing need not care about dest uniqueness. The parsing is akin
      to seeing arguments and putting them into viable slots. No deep problems
      are caused by multiple slots accepting the same kinds of things.

    - Result creation is the place where unification by dest occurs. Consider
      Opts with different types: -x <x> <x>. This causes no technical problem,
      because the Result can be merged correctly: Result.x = [bool, [x1, x2]].
      The only problem is that the data has an odd structure. The user can
      easily fix that with a different Optopus configuration. If needed, Optous
      can support an option to generate unique dests in the Result (eg, via
      variant/group prefixes). Also see notes below for one type of complex
      Result (for nab).

        - Would this really work in more complex scenarios?
        - See parsed-data-structure

    - Usage text will closely mimic the naming and structure of the user's
      spec. If there is ambiguity from duplicate dests, the user either wants
      it or they can easy adjust by configuring syms/dests differently.

    - For Opt-spec text, Section configuration can drive the process. Any
      section containing an opt-spec configuration for an Opt will display the
      opt-spec line. This allows the common use case where an Opt should be
      listed in multiple places in the help text. If two Opts having the same
      dest are in the same Section, Optopus will generate an opt-spec line for
      each Opt, but if the resulting text is the same, it will prune the
      duplicate(s).

Result for the nab example:

    - If the 'cmd' dest were NOT in the nab spec, the Result would be
      narrowly correct, but difficult for the user to understand at
      runtime, because every dest would be a flat list of values, some of them
      coming from different 'cmd' invocations. Nonetheless, there is nothing
      narrowly "incorrect" about this outcome; if the user does not like it,
      the solution is a better configuration.

        Result(
            debug = t1,
            help  = h1,
            cmd   = [chomp, findall, grep, grep, range, run],
            rgx   = [       r1,      r2,   r3              ],
            i     = [                i1,   i2,          i3 ],
            v     = [                v1,   v2,          v3 ],
            s     = [                s1,   s2              ],
            start = [                            s1        ],
            stop  = [                            s1        ],
            step  = [                            s1        ],
            g     = [                            g1,    g1 ],
            code  = [                                   c1 ],
            a     = [       a1,                         a2 ],
        )

    - If the cmd dest is used, the Result will organize things in
      a meaningful way.

        Result(
            debug = t1,
            help  = h1,
            cmd = [
                # Each Result is a column in the tabular arrangement above.
                Result(chomp),
                Result(findall, r1, a1),
                Result(grep, r2, i1, v1, v1),
                Result(grep, r3, i2, v2, v2),
                Result(range, s1, s1, s2),
                Result(run, i3, v3, g2, c1, a2),
            ],
        )

--------
parsed-data-structure: Parsed data structuring: nargs, nparams, ntimes
--------

** Edit this section to reflect new policy:
    - Need to handle reuse of same Opt.name.

    - Example:

        - Spec.

            <x>... -x <x> -x <x>{2}

        - Result.

            opts.x = [
                [X, ...], # <x>...
                bool,     # -x
                X         # <x>
                [X, X]    # -x <x>{2}
            ]

The meaning of nparams, nargs, and ntimes:

    nparams : N of params (for options)
    nargs   : N args (for positionals)
    ntimes  : Governs only optionality and repetition via {m,n} or its shortcuts.

    Options:                    #  nparams  ntimes

        -y                      #  0        (1,1)
        [-y]                    #  0        (0,1)
        [-y {} {}]              #  2        (0,1)
        -y {} [{}]              #  (1,2)    (1,1)
        -y {}{3}                #  3        (1,1)      # C

    Positionals:                #  nargs    ntimes

        <x>                     #  1        (1,1)
        [<x>]                   #  1        (0,1)
        (<x> <x> <x>){0,2}      #  3        (0,2)
        -----------------------------------------
        <x> <x> <x>             #  3        (1,1)      # A
        <x>{3}                  #  1        (3,3)      # B

Is nargs needed? Why not handle it all with ntimes?

    - Examples A and B are similar but differ in their non-flattened data:

        A: [X1, X2, X2]
        B: [[X1], [X2], [X3]]

    - Users should prefer to configure positionals with nargs first, using
      ntimes only when required (eg, plural nargs and plural ntimes) or when
      they want Result data organized a certain way.

    - Example C illustrates that {m,n} is not just for ntimes:

        - Parameters do not have their own independent ntimes attribute.

        - So the quantifier is interpreted as affecting nparams.

Internally, all data assigned to destinations will be stored in a fully
explicit manner. Assume a list of lists, where:

    Opt attribute | Determines length of
    ------------------------------------
    nargs/nparams | inner list
    ntimes        | outer list

    - Singular nargs/nparams and ntimes:

        a1     # Either value or bool (latter if nargs/nparams is zero).

    - Plural nargs/nparams:

        [a1, a2, ...]

    - With plural ntimes:

        (<z> <z>){3}

        [[a1, a2], ..., ...]

    - With a layer of nested plural ntimes:

        (
            --foo <> <>
            (<z> <z>){3}
        ){4}

        foo: nparams 2, ntimes     4
        z  : nargs   2, ntimes 3 x 4

        foo = [[a1, a2], ..., ..., ...]

        z = [
            [[a1, a2], ..., ...],
            ...
            ...
            ...
        ]

Default flattening policy:

    - If the grammar does not contain nested plural ntimes, data
      will be flattened as much as possible, as shown in table below.

    - User can request non-flattened data or flattened (the latted
      to flatten even the 2x2 or nested scenarios).

    nargs or | ntimes    | ntimes 2+                   | ntimes 2+
    nparams  | 0 or 1    | Flattened                   | Non-flattened
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    0        | bool      | [bool, ...]                 | [[bool], ...]
    1        | a1        | [a1, ...]                   | [[a1], ...]
    2+       | [a1, ...] | [[a1, ...], [a1, ...], ...] | .

--------
eager-attachment-at-bounary: Eager option attachment at repetition boundaries
--------

In the following example, the -z option will bind eagerly to the repeated
triplets of positionals.

    Grammar:                  cmds=(<a> <b> <c> [-z]){2,7}
    Example input:            A1 B1 C1 -z A2 B2 C2
    Returned data for cmds:   opts.cmds[1] = Namespace(a=A1, b=B1, c=C1, z=False)

That policy is consistent with greedy parsing elsewhere. Configuration for this
issue will have to be done via the API.

--------
grammar-syntax-named-unnamed: Grammar syntax: named and unnamed arguments
--------

Positionals must be named:

    frob <a> <b> [<c>]

Option arguments can be named or unnamed:

                                        # opts.mode:
    frob --mode {group} {name} {n}      # - Data object with attributes.
    frob --mode {} {} {}                # - List.

--------
variants-needed: Variants: why they are needed
--------

Are variants needed give that the grammar syntax already has support for
alternatives? Yes: they provide several benefits, even if one could do
without them, strictly speaking.

Partial variants are a useful device to express some grammars more
conveniently.

Usage variants are a good mechanism for the user to help Optopus generate more
readable usage text and more relevant portions of it in response to errors.

Variants can provide a low-config mechanism for subcommand-style programs to
provide subcommand help text.

Variants have been a useful concept, and their names convenient handles, when
thinking about and planning this project. That utility might come in handy
later.

So one might think of the following related concepts, from most general
to most specific:

    Group           # Any grouping of grammar elements.
    Alternative     # A grouping where the end-user should choose one.
    Variant         # An alternative that strongly affects usage text.

--------
destination-assignment: General destination assignment: needed after all
--------

Optopus does need generalized destination assignment. At a minimum, it needs
that feature not just for Opt, but also for partial variants. And once you go
that far, you might as well generalize it.

Consider examples like neck-diagram (nab is similar). With destination
assignment, the specific Opt destinations (cmd, snum, syms, etc) will be nested
underneath the 'commands' namespace (the outer destination assignment). The returned
data would have this structure:

    opts.commands : (
        Namespace(cmd = 'snum', snum = 6),
        Namespace(cmd = 'tuning', notes = ('E', 'A', ...)),
        Namespace(cmd = 'fret', syms = ('1', '3', '5')),
        ...
    )

Without the outer assignment, the returned data would be grouped by the Opt
destination names -- which badly jumbles everything up:

    opts = Namespace(
        cmd   : ['snum, 'tuning', 'fnum', 'fret', 'fret', ...]
        snum  : ['6']
        fnum  : ['5']
        notes : [[...]]
        syms  : [[...], [...], ]
    )

--------
grammar-syntax-complexity: Grammar syntax: is it too complex?
--------

To evaluate the question, I focused on the least intuitive aspect of the syntax
and compared it against the API-driven alternative:

Alternatives:

    - This is an easy call: syntax is intuitive and API usage for this
      situation is annoying.

    - This is a strong example of the superiority of text syntax for grammar
      configuration relative to API.

Quantifiers:

    - The ... is intuitive and practically a convention.

    - The {m,n} syntax directly mimics regex and is also quite intutive.

General destination assignment:

    - This feature is powerful: it allows grammar variation when
      a positional or parameter takes a specific value.

    - Configuring such matters via the API requires the user to understand how
      the library works a bit too closely.

Partial variants:

    - API usage would require the user make multiple configurations to mark a
      variant as partial and then insert it wherever needed.

    - The partial syntax isn't heavy; in fact, it's moderately intuitve and
      without it, the grammar syntax might even be a bit less immediately
      understandable.

Zones and anchoring:

    - Decisions:
        - Infrequent use case.
        - Easy to handle via API.
        - Drop from grammar syntax.
        - Also see zones-not-needed

    - I suspect the desire for zones and anchoring is moderately low but still
      more than nothing.

    - Also, configuring these parameters via the API is simple to understand
      and requires little code.

    - While the zone syntax not too obtrusive, and it is a mixture of intuitive
      (zone markers) and not very intuitive (anchor markers)

    - Another question: is the zone concept needed, or could Group do the same
      thing? I increasingly think so.

High precedence:

    - Setting this attribute is easy in the API.

    - Although the syntax is not heavy, it's also not fully intuitive.

    - The majority of use cases will get the built-in help behavior, and the
      library could interpret --help and --version options as high precedence
      by default.

    - Infrequent use case, easy via the API: let's drop it from grammar syntax.

--------
optional-positional-placement: Optional positionals before required are not a problem
--------

One might be concerned about Grammars containing optional positionals before
required ones. For example:

    [<m>] <x> <y>

But this is not a problem if we adhere consistently to greedy policy. If the
user wants positionals attached to <x> and <y> before <m>, they can express the
grammar differently.

--------
parse-known-args: Parse known arguments
--------

How argparse handles it:

    - Instead of returning a single Namespace it returns a tuple:

        (Namespace, List[unknown args])

    - It does still apply all validations to any supplied arguments.

I have found that approach mildly annoying:

    - It requires a change to the calling code to call a different
      method and to unpack the 2-tuple.

    - That makes it a bit less convenient to drive via typical configuration
      mechanisms.

I think it makes more sense for Optopus to treat parse-known-args as one of the
parsing modes that it supports:

    Parsing modes:

        Configured: these modes can be combined. They relax the rules to allow
        deviations. [I am not sold on this naming idea. Think it over.]

            unknown-ok
            unconverted-ok
            invalid-ok

        No configuration:

            Like the rest of the library, Optopus will handle no-config parsing
            with a greedy default. Consider:

            No-config parsing is only helpful for the options: positionals
            will be dumped into a single generic bucket, so the options are
            what matter here.

            The positionals can be segregated to follow the double-hyphen
            marker.

            The rest of the input will be options and parameters, which
            raise no ambiguous boundary questions.

            This means the end user can control the result via their
            arrangement of arguments. That seems consistent with the spirit of
            no-config: no-configuration means imposing no requirements on the
            end-user. Through their argument placement, the end-user determines
            how parameters bind to options, which means they can achieve
            different flavors of parameter binding (flag, key-val, or any N of
            vals).

            In addition, the library will support an almost-noconfig behavior
            allowing the user to impose a specific parameter binding
            requirement. That will be done via a quantifier controlling nparams
            to be consumed per option.

                * The name (noconf) seems cryptic. Could it be nparams?

                Parser()                # Default: greedy.
                Parser(noconf = '0')    # Flag style
                Parser(noconf = '1')    # Key-val style
                Parser(noconf = '2,')   # 2+

Optopus:

    - By default:

        - Continue to return a single Result object.

        - Put the unknown arguments in an attribute with an uncommon name, such
          as 'others' or 'unknowns'.

    - Let the user configure this:

        - Name of the unknowns attribute.

        - Whether to return (Result, List[unknowns]) tuple, like argparse.

--------
zones-not-needed: Zones not needed
--------

In my planning I think the concept of Zones was not useful. A zone has no
purpose on its own; rather, it existed purely to support anchoring. And the
anchoring configuration was applied to Opts, not Zones. Just use Groups and
allow Opts to be anchored within them.

--------
help-distpatching: Help distpatching
--------

Optopus aims to support behavior like this:

    frob --help              # Print general help.
    frob configure --help    # Print help for the configure task.

How does the user configure this help dispatching. More generally, what about
supporting other help-printing scenarios that rely not on --help but on some
other options: for example, I've had programs where I want --examples to print
some usage examples for the end-user.

    - Simple use case: standard help feature for a command-line program.

        p = Parser(help = True|False)

    - Help hook: any time the library's help feature is triggered, call the
      user's function with some params and let them return something to tell
      the library which help section(s) to print, if any.

        p = Parser(help = CALLABLE)

    - That approach is flexible for the general case, but it does not speak to
      the most common type of complex use case (a program with subcommands,
      where the subcommands and help sections have a 1:1 correspondence). Some
      additional conveniences to support dispatching based on subcommands --
      or, more correctly, based on the value taken by a specific Opt.

        # For 1:1 correspondence between help sections and Opt values.
        o = Opt('task', help = 'sections')

        # For more flexibility, supply mapping from Opt value to section name.
        o = Opt('task', help = DICT)

--------
dispatch: Dispatch
--------

Dispatching is probably can be pretty simple: tie one or more callables to
Variants, Opts, or even Groups (hard to think of many use cases for the latter,
but it is probably easy to support).

The argument passing details are important. Not everyone wants opts to be
passed everywhere. In other notes, I planned to have dispatch functions called
with three arguments.

    # I suspect that this plan is not good.

    VAL | Value for the Opt
    OPT | Opt triggering the call
    RES | Result from Parser.parse()

Dispatch occurs after argument parsing and validation. At that point, it is not
clear why the dispatch function needs VAL and OPT. Nor does it seem like users
want all of their dispatch functions tied to a rigid signature (eg, always
passing RES everywhere).

What might users want to pass to dispatch calls?

    - The parsed Result (which does not exist at config-time).
    - Other objects (eg lib).
    - One or more Result.DEST values, perhaps as kwargs.

Example API usages:

    - The example is based on my pocket script, which could be reframed with
      usage variants such as experiment, interactive, and rebuild.

    - The imported RES is a simple configuration object to tell Optopus
      to pass the parsed Result to the dispatch function.

    - The RES.foo examples mean to pass the value of Result.foo.

    - And the dispatcher() function returns a configured object telling Optopus
      which args/kwargs to pass to the function. Its signature is 1+ callables
      plus kwargs.

        from optopus import Parser, RES, dispatcher

        # Load the Pocket library and configure the Parser.
        lib = ...
        p = Parser(...)

        # Some dispatchers.
        de = dispatcher(experiment)
        di = dispatcher(do_interactive, lib, RES)
        dr = dispatcher(rebuild_library, limit = RES.limit, progress = RES.progress)

        # Tie those dispatchers to usage variants.
        p.config('experiment', dispatch = de)
        p.config('interactive', dispatch = di)
        p.config('rebuild', dispatch = dr)

That example illustrates one way to achieve a fairly generalized support for
dispatching. A simpler usage form might also be nice -- namely, either a single
callable or a sequence of callables. In this case they are simply passed the
parsed Result.

    p.config('foo', dispatch = f)
    p.config('foo', dispatch = (g, h))

Also worth considering whether it makes any sense to tie dispatching to
positional and parameter variants. For example:

    p.config('task=experiment', dispatch = de)
    p.config('task=interactive', dispatch = di)
    p.config('task=rebuild', dispatch = dr)

--------
argparse-and-greed: argparse and greediness
--------

The argparse library does attach arguments greedily, but it makes no attempt
to backtrack. An example:

    Grammar:

        -z {}... <y> <y>

    Example input:

        -z A B C D E F

    Behavior:

        - Attach everything to -z.
        - Raise error because <y> not given.

--------
end-user-errors: End-user errors
--------

The problem:

    - Each Parser.parse(args) call will generate up to N failures, one per
      interpretation.

    - Ideally, we would report the error most aligned with end-user intent.

    - How do we select the error to report?

Initial ideas for mechanisms to select the most relevant error:

    - Error type, under the theory that some errors are more likely to
      convey intent about which alternative was (or was not) intended.

    - Percentage of input args matched, under regular parsing or
      perhaps forge-ahead parsing.

    - Percentage of available options present in the arguments, under the
      theory that the presence of options is one of the more telling indicators
      of intent. This metric is fairly easy to compute (a frequency distribution
      of options present).

Inferring intent from error types is tempting but not always so powerful:

    - Globally unknown options are an easy case: always select this error,
      because it's true under any interpretation.

    - One might think that an inapplicable option conveys that the current
      interpretation was not intended. But it's easy to create
      counter-examples: for example, a large N of arguments that work perfectly
      for the current interpretation, but the end-user inadvertently included
      an option for a different variant as the first argument (maybe when
      editing a prior command from shell history).

    - Invalid values might seem like an indication the current interpretation
      was intended, under the theory that the args were allocated to a slot but
      just failed in the details. But to know that with any confidence you need
      forge-ahead parsing.

The resolution is to consider how other parsers behave:

    - They always try to consume as much of the input as possible. This
      suggests that the first criterion for error-selection is to maximize S.ai.

    - Multiple interpretations can fail with the same S.ai. To resolve ties,
      consider how errors can occur (consuming an OPT, consuming a POS, or
      during final checks). For each of those cases, the error-reporting
      precedence is fairly clear-cut [listed below].

    - To resolve ties, report the error associated with the earliest
      alternative, based on the grammar.

Types of errors in precedence order, by failure source:

    - Trying to consume an OPT:

        - Globally unknown option.

        - Inapplicable option for current alternative (but known to grammar).

    - Trying to consume a POS:

        - Conversion/validation problems: params.

        - Conversion/validation problems: positionals.

        - Excess arguments.

    - Making final checks:

        - Insufficient ntimes: option.

        - Insufficient nparams.

        - Insufficient ntimes: positional.

        - Insufficient nargs.

--------
converters-validators: Converters and validators
--------

** Does the discussion in the dispatch section [above] cause me
   to rethink the approach here -- specifically for validators.

Function signatures:

    Function  | Signature
    -----------------------------------------------
    Converter | STR            => OBJ/raise
    Validator | VAL, OPT, RES  => True/False/raise
    Dispatch  | VAL, OPT, RES  => None                # No. See dispatch section [above].

--------
grammar-querying-api: Grammar querying API
--------

Grammary querying API

    - Because the Grammar can be a tree structure, the API needs good syntax to
      query for grammar elements, both for configuration needs (including the
      ability to perform bulk configurations) and for complex validations.

    - Possible approach:

        g.get(NAME, NAME, ...)          # Get one, dive-style.
        g.get(NAME, [NAME, ...], ...)   # Get multiple.

--------
validation-notes: Validation notes
--------

What to validate:

    - Only user-facing code: the entry points.

    - Let internal code blow up if given bad input.

Consider using a library:

    - valid8 is interesting but seems a bit over-engineered.

    - Its docs point to other tools that could have interesting ideas.

If not a library, consider implementing a simple validation module for the
project:

    - Some of the libraries I saw treated the process very formally, with a
      large API to learn.

    - A simpler approach seems better.

        validate(
            value,      # Value to check.
            convert,    # Callable: value => converted-value
            validate,   # Callable: converted-value => bool
            error,      # Error to raise.
        )

Where should validation logic reside?

    - Option 1: near the call site, so that you do not have to look elsewhere
      to understand the function.

        - Using decorator. Validation library writers seem attracted to this
          approach, but I don't see the appeal. It does not save any typing,
          and I find decorators with a lot of content to be awkward looking --
          aesthetically unappealing.

            @validate(
                x = (
                    int,
                    lambda x: x in range(1,11),
                    'x parameter must be interger 1 through 10: {val}',
                ),
                y = (...),
                z = (...),
            )
            def bar(x, y, z):
                ...

        - Or just using an ordinary function:

            def bar(x, y, z):
                validate(
                    x,
                    int,
                    lambda x: x in range(1,11),
                    'x parameter must be interger 1 through 10: {val}',
                )
                validate(y, ...)
                validate(z, ...)
                ...

    - Option 2: put validation logic a separate module, consolidating such
      details in one location. Let readers focus on the happy-path substance of
      the function, not the grubby validation logic, exception raising, etc.
      That code is mostly formulaic anyway -- stick it in the footnotes.

            # Main code.

            @validate
            def bar(x, y, z):
                ...

            # Validation module:

            register_validators(
                bar = (
                    x,
                    int,
                    lambda x: x in range(1,11),
                    'x parameter must be interger 1 through 10: {val}',
                ),
                ...
            )

        Under this approach, you want the validators to be composable, with the
        ability to define a bigger validator using smaller validators.
        And such compositions may need some helpers:

            validate_all()

--------
strategy-reassessment: Reassess the strategy
--------

After further reflection and looking again at the various job-client* example
scripts, I realize I underestimated the power of the text-based configuration
syntax.

    - It's true that I did find writing the literal help text tedious. I also
      dislike the idea that it will lack dynamic formatting behavior.

    - However, the API based configuration is very ineffecient and repetitive
      compared to the brevity, clarity, and intutiveness of the text approach.

    - Perhaps the right path, again, is to used text-driven configuration, but
      as syntax, not literal help text.

Consider which parts of the ultimate help text must be typed directly by the
programmer:

    - Option or argument names.
    - Help text for each option/argument.
    - Metavars.
    - Aliases.
    - Section names.
    - Choice values (if simple strings).

The simplest, clearest way to write that material is as a block of options
text. Lines likes these cover all of those bases:

    General::
    --job-id -j ID    : The job id.
    --od-user -u USER : Open Directory user who submitted the job.

The only other configurations are (a) syntax for complex grammars, and (b)
stuff well handled by the API (defaults, types, conversion, validation,
dispatch, sometimes choices, etc).

And this text-centric approach is flexible in allowing a variety of
usage patterns:

    - It can be treated as literal options text, for those who prefer that
      approach. Essentialy, Optopus will support a Docopt mode.

    - But treating it as configuration syntax will be easier for many who (1)
      don't want to have to lay everything out precisely and (2) especially
      don't want to have to define a usage grammar even for programs with
      standard command-line needs. If the API approach is ineffecient
      generally, the literal-text approach is ineffecient in requiring a usage
      grammar every time (as docopt does).

The write-up will need to be reframed to emphasize the debt to the text-based
argument parsers and to criticize the API approach for being so inefficient. In
the writeup place greater emphasis on some practical examples illustrating the
superiority of the text-based approach over argparse.

--------
grammar-syntax-revisited: Grammar syntax revisited
--------

Enhance spec syntax increase its power, reducing user hassle:

    - Program name.
    - Options text, optionally with section titles.
    - Opt symbols.
    - Regular text.

Simplify and unify the syntax:

    - Ensure that Optopus supports the full spectrum of usages, ranging from
      quick-and-dirty to complex.

    - Prioritize ease of use for the simplest cases.

        - Program name optional.
        - Variant names optional.
        - Section headings optional.

    - Minimize baroque syntax elements:

        - Reduce special punctuation when possible.
        - Meaningful whitespace is more intuitive that odd punctuation.
        - Make surviving punctuation as unified/congruous as possible.

Use angle brackets for all variable end-user inputs:

    - See variable-end-user-input.

Punctuation markers:

    - Summary of plan:

        Situation       | Marker       | When required
        -------------------------------------------------
        Grammar section | Double colon | If variant(s)
        Other sections  | Double colon | Always
        Opt-spec        | Colon        | If help text
        Variant         | Colon        | If named

    - Sections:

        - The grammar section:

            - Must appear first in the spec. If user wants a different section
              ordering: define the sections in the spec; use API to move
              sections as needed.

            - No regular text.

            - Default title is `Usage`, configurable only via API.

        - The grammar section, regardless of form, can be followed by zero or
          more other sections that:

            - Must use marker.
            - Can omit a title.
            - Can define opt-spec lines.
            - Can include regular text.

            - If a line parses as opt-spec, it will be interpreted that way
              (unless quoting is used).

        - What if the user does not want a trailing colon on section titles?

            - Let them adjust via the API.

    - opt-spec:

        - Supported Opt grammar subset:

            sym
            dest
            nargs
            nparams
            ntimes
            choices
            aliases
            text

        - Note that opt-spec uses a grammar subset, not an alternative grammar:

            - This means, for example, that options are not assumed
              to be optional: square brackets required if intended.

        - Note that opt-spec lines can be confused with unnamed variants. The
          issue is fundamental, not really addressable via extended peeks or
          other fancy parsing. For example, does this spec define 3 variants or
          3 bare-bones opt-spec lines?

            pgrep
            <rgx>
            --ignore-case -i
            --invert-match -v

            - Ultimately, I decided to rely on a greedy parsing policy to
              address this potential ambiguity.

                - The ambiguous examples are not compelling use cases.
                - In first section, first look for variants.
                - If user is unhappy with the parser, the configuration problem
                  is easily noticed and easily fixed (add a trailing colon to
                  the first lines that should be treated as opt-spec rather
                  than variant).

        - The most common use case is to derive grammar from 1+ opt-spec
          sections. It works well for many standard grammar needs, and opt-spec
          is more featureful than variant (because it supports aliases and
          help text). So the no-variant use case should have the least hassle.

Dest, sym, and values:

    - Examples without choices:

        <paths>...              | <paths>...            | paths

--------
spec-as-format-string: Spec as a format string not needed
--------

Initially I thought it would be useful to allow the spec to function as a
format string.

But if the format() call occurs early (before spec parsing), there is no
purpose served: the user could just call format() to create the spec in the
first place.

There might be a use case for calling format() after parsing has derived
grammar and opt-spec metadata.

    - Presumably the purpose would be to insert material into help text that is
      more under the domain of Optopus than the user.

    - Another possible use case is to call format() after end-user
      arguments are parsed -- eg, in response to error.

    - Defer this until a use case is known.

--------
variable-end-user-input: Representing variable end-user inputs
--------

There are four common styles for representing variable end-user input, along
with some differences in details for specific implementations, especially as it
relates to choices:

    Style     | Parameters  | Positionals | Choices | Examples
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Angle     | <>          | <>          | {}      | git, picocli
    Sensitive | UPPER       | lower       | {}      | argparse, many Python/Ruby
    Lower     | lower       | lower       | () []   | POSIX, many Unix utilities
    Upper     | UPPER       | UPPER       | () [] ? | rsync
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Docopt    | <> or UPPER | <>          | () [] ? | .
    Optopus   | <>          | <>          | <>      | .

    - Unclear how docopt and rsync handle choices, but I think they use
      parens/brackets.

Upper and lower styles: easily rejected:

    - They work poorly for positional variants and parameter variants.

    - Usage text is ambiguous: we cannot distinguish merge/delete (literal
      values for positional variants) from path (variable input).

        frob [-f] merge [-x] [-y] path
        frob [-f] delete [-z] path

Sensitive style: better but not fully robust:

    - It handles most situations:

        frob [-f] merge [-x] [-y] PATH
        frob [-f] delete [-z] PATH

    - And the Python/Ruby community is accustomed to it.

    - It does fail if the variant values need to be uppercase. Some type of
      quoting or other syntactic workaround would be needed:

        frob [-f] `MERGE` [-x] [-y] PATH
        frob [-f] `DELETE` [-z] PATH

Angle style: robust due to greed:

    - In order to produce robust usage text for variants, literal inputs need
      top precedence.

    - More generally, treating text (whether in grammar syntax or usage text)
      as literal by default, it an good baseline (eg, that is how regex works).

    - The conclusion is that variable inputs must be enclosed, making
      case-based solutions either flawed or insufficiently robust.

    - Optopus was drifting toward {param} and <pos> as the enclosures:

        - That would also be an odd combo. The only precedent is docopt,
          which supports it only as an alternative syntax.

        - In addition, braces have a semi-conventional role for choices in
          tools like argparse, so using them for parameters would be
          anti-conventional.

    - Will there be ambiguities if parameters and positionals have the
      same enclosure?

        --point <x> <y>   # How many parameters?

    - Initially, I thought that parentheses/brackets could resolve such matters
      (see Git usage text, for example). But the brackets do not solve the
      problem by themselves. For example, is this an optional option with 2
      parameters or an optional group with a flag and 2 positionals?

        [--point <x> <y>]

    - Once again, embracing a greedy policy sorts everything out. If parameters
      bind eagerally to angle-bracketed inputs, then the example above is a
      2-parameter option.

Verdict: angle style:

    - The clarity of the approach seems to more than counterbalance the
      small increment of extra typing: all variable inputs are enclosed in
      the same way (positionals, parameters, and thus choices).

    - The approach has strong precedent, especially from Git.

    - Brackets and greedy will sort out any ambiguity:

        [--point <x> <y>] <z>  # 2-param option, required positional.

    - If needed later, support other styles for usage text and grammar
      syntax (especially sensitive). Note that sensitive style in usage
      text is partially supported via the SYM! notation.

--------
enhanced-quantifiers: Enhanced quantifiers
--------

Quantifiers could be more featureful:

    - A third parameter similar to a range step:

        <x>{0,6,2}      # 0, 2, 4, 6

    - Ability to support noncontiguous quantities:

        <x>{!1,2,3,5}   # 1, 2, 3, or 5

--------
opt-spec-lines: Opt-spec lines
--------

In the grammar syntax, an opt-spec line allows any syntax for configuring a
single Opt, plus two other things: aliases and help text.

I considered adding a rule to require that the aliases, if any, reside
separate from the grammar of the Opt configuration. An illustration:

    -f [--foo <>]          # OK.
    -o (--opt <> <>){3}    # OK.

    [-f --foo <>]          # Not OK: the -f alias should be outside brackets.

But the rule seems needlessly touchy. Since configuring a single
Opt already requires nearly the full grammar, it makes more sense to parse
the line as follows:

    expression [: [help-text]]

Then examine expression to extract any aliases and validate that it configures
only a single Opt.

Because it would be difficult to distinguish opt-spec continuation lines from
lines of regular text in a section, I decided to require block-quoting for
regular text. This keeps parsing relative sane at a modest cost in usage.

Opt-specs lines can also define help text for positional/parameter
variants. The default help text for such elements (ie, without
any explicit section configuration) is as follows:

    # Configuration:

        <task>             : Task to perform
        <task=foo>         : Foo blah
        <task=bar>         : Bar blah

        --mode <fast|slow> : Mode to use
        --mode <=fast>     : Fast blah
        --mode <=slow>     : Slow blah

    # Resulting help text:

        Positionals: task:
          foo                Foo blah
          bar                Bar blah

        Options: --mode:
          --mode fast        Fast blah
          --mode slow        Slow blah

--------
group-level-validation-needed: Why Group-level validation should be retained
--------

If focusing just on ntimes, one might be tempted to collapse Group validation
needs (primarily ntimes) down to the Opts. Some of the discussion in
parsed-data-structure, for example, loosely speaks in such terms.

But the Groups do impose their own requirments. In this example, the ntimes of
the Opts are inter-linked: if any one appears, the requirements of the others
changes dynamically.

    [ -x -y [-i] ]

But Groups do have other attributes: dest and maybe validate. And it seems
difficult to imagine all consequences of grammar flattening. Every time I
experimented with it in the past, problems were encountered. It is possible
that a Target might flatten Group-level ntimes down to the Opts purely for
convenience during parsing. But it seems important to retain the ability to
impose requirements at the Group level rather than only at the Opt level.
Finally, because Groups can nest, storing their requirements at the Opt level
is not immediately straightforward.

readme-next-version: README for next version
--------

Add some default setting to at least one example.

Ultimately, readme should be more how-to than why.

As lib evolves, shorten readme to have very short intro; how to use; then brief
discussion of why its better (maybe bullet points even), with links to longer
discussions of why-build-it and how-it-is-better.

pegs-cfgs-and-packrat-parsing: PEGs, CFGs, and packrat parsing
--------

Resource:

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1410477/what-is-packrat-parsing

Many parsers use context-free grammars (CFG). For example:

    E -> E * E | E + E | (E) | N
    N -> D | DN
    D -> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

    Rule 1: nonterminal E can be replaced E * E, etc.
    Rule 2: nonterminal N can be replaced by D or DN.
    Rule 3: nonterminal D can be replaced by any single digit.

    The rules can generate any simple arithmetic expression using +, *, parens,
    and single digits.

CFGs are a compact way to represent a collection of strings and they have a
rich and well-understood theory. However, they have two main drawbacks.

    - A CFG defines a collection of strings, but doesn't tell you how to check
      check a string for validity. This means that whether a particular CFG
      will lend itself to a nice parser depends on the particulars of how the
      parser works, meaning that the grammar author may need to familiarize
      themselves with the internal workings of their parser generator to
      understand what restrictions are placed on the sorts of grammar
      structures can arise.

    - Grammars can be ambiguous. For example, the above grammar generates the
      string 2 + 3 * 4, but does so in two ways. In one way, we essentially get
      the grouping 2 + (3 * 4), which is what's intended. The other one gives
      us (2 + 3) * 4, which is not what's meant. This means that grammar
      authors either need to ensure that the grammar is unambiguous or need to
      introduce precedence declarations auxiliary to the grammar to tell the
      parser how to resolve the conflicts. This can be a bit of a hassle.

Parsing expression grammars (PEG) are alternatives to CFGs. Here's the same
arithmetic example in PEG form:

    E -> F + E | F
    F -> T * F | T
    T -> D* | (E)
    D -> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 / 9

A key feature of PEGs is explicit ordering of parsing alternatives. The syntax
can be read as "First try this, then this, etc". In that sense, PEGs directly
encode into the grammar structure itself how the parsing is to be done. This
approach resolves the ambiguity noted above and lends itself toward direct
translation from grammar to parser generation.

The Packrat Parsing Algorithm builds on the PEG approach. The algorithm is
conceptually quite simple. At a high level, a packrat parser begins with the
start symbol, then tries the ordered choices, one at a time, in sequence until
it finds one that works. As it works through those choices, it may find that it
needs to match another nonterminal, in which case it recursively tries matching
that nonterminal on the rest of the string. If a particular choice fails, the
parser backtracks and then tries the next production.

The algorithm combines the PEG approach with memoization (essentially dynamic
programming without the bookkeeping) to achieve linear performance.

Formal grammars:

    In formal language theory, a grammar describes how to form strings from a
    language's alphabet (or elemental values) that are valid according to the
    language's syntax.

    More specically, a grammar consists of:

        - A finite set N of nonterminal symbols (disjoint from the strings
          formed from G).

        - A finite set T of terminal symbols (disjoint from N).

        - A finite set P of production rules for rewriting strings via
          substitution.

    A grammar is usually thought of as a language generator. However, it can
    also sometimes be used as the basis for a recognizer -- a function in
    computing that determines whether a given string belongs to the language or
    is grammatically incorrect. To describe such recognizers, formal language
    theory uses separate formalisms, known as automata theory.

    Parsing is the process of recognizing an utterance (a string in natural
    languages) by breaking it down to a set of symbols and analyzing each one
    against the grammar of the language.

    Most languages have the meanings of their utterances structured according
    to their syntax—a practice known as compositional semantics. As a result,
    the first step to describing the meaning of an utterance in language is to
    break it down part by part and look at its analyzed form (known as its
    parse tree in computer science, and as its deep structure in generative
    grammar).

Chomsky Hierarchy:

    The following table summarizes each of Chomsky's four types of grammars, the
    class of language it generates, the type of automaton that recognizes it, and
    the form its rules must have.

    Grammar | Languages               | Recognizer automaton       | Allowed production rules
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Type-3  | Regular                 | Finite state               | A   => a | aB
    Type-2  | Context-free            | Non-deterministic pushdown | A   => x
    Type-1  | Context-sensitive       | LB-ND Turing machine       | xAy => xzy
    Type-0  | Recursively enumberable | Turing machine             | z   => x

    Symbols and abbreviations:

        * These symbols are not standard. Typically, uppercase are terminals,
          lowercase are non-terminals, and Greek are sequences of either.

        a     | Terminal
        ---------------------------------------------
        M     | Non-terminal
        N     | Same
        ---------------------------------------------
        x     | Sequence of terminals or non-terminals
        y     | Same
        z     | Same, and this one cannot empty
        ---------------------------------------------
        LB-ND | Linear-bounded non-deterministic

    Understanding the production rules:

        - Regular grammar (Type-3) is very rigid. Every non-terminal produces
          at least a left-side terminal. The automaton requires no memory and
          can make each decision based on the information directly at hand.

            Classic example (using regex quantifier notation):

                L = a{n}

                X = ''
                X = a
                X = Xa

            In other words, the language consisting of all strings of
            consisting of zero or more letter a.

        - Context-free grammar (Type-2) is more open: a non-terminal can
          generate sequences of terminals and/or non-terminals. The constraint
          is that every non-terminal maps to exactly one pre-defined thing.
          Mappings never change dynamically during parsing. This automaton
          requires memory to support backtracking (classically, a stack).

            Classic example:

                L = a{n} b{n}

                X = ''
                X = ab
                X = aXa
                X = bXb

            To recognize strings in this language, the parser needs to remember
            how many letter a were seen.

        - Context-sensitive (Type-1) can be understood in relation to
          context-free. If you look only at the middle terms, you see the
          context-free production rule just discussed (A => z). But now what
          each non-terminal maps to can differ depending on the context (x and
          y are the surrounding context on both sides of the rule).

            Classic example:

                L = a{n} b{n} c{n}

            At first, I did not understand why this is any different than a{n}
            b{n}. Couldn't you just remember N in the same way? Perhaps the
            answer lies less in the ordinary practicalities of how one would
            implement a real parser but in writing the grammar rules.

        - Context-sensitive (Type-0) is wide open, no constraints on the
          grammar.

App::Cmd

    - Conclusion: not sure that I'm sold on this.

    - The documentation is difficult.

    - The module uses Params::Validate and Getopt::Long::Descriptive, and it
      does not appear to be flexible in that regard.

Getopt::Long::Descriptive

    - Front end for Getopt::Long

    - Promising in several respects.

    - One could write a subclass to modify help text output.

    - But it does not support the basic element of a option arg name (eg
      --logfile PATH)

    - So subclassing will take you only so far.

    - Supports concept of "implies": if -X, then -Y and -Z are required.

    - Support concept of a hidden option (not in help text).

Getopt::Tabular

    - Tabular spec definition

    - Validation

    - Help text: not bad, but not controllable

    - Can parse an array besides ARGV

    - Looks unmaintained.

Getopt::Lucid:

    - Interesting approach

    - Emphasizes readability of specification

    - Uses a chainable module when defining specs

    - Also allows you to merge options with config

    - Does not produce help text

Getopt::Euclid

    - Creates parser from your application's POD, specifically:

    - The POD can also include validation assertions.

    - Still active.

    - Takes input from @ARGV and puts results in %ARGV

    - I don't like the fact that it uses globals and is non-OO

Getopt::Simple

    - Wrapper around Getopt::Long

    - Produces help text.

Getopt::Declare

    - Builds option parser from a help-text string

    - It's an interesting idea.

    - Requires a special syntax to define the spec and that syntax is embedded
      in the help string

    - Getargs::Long
    - Pod::WikiDoc

Pod::Usage

    - You document your application with POD.

    - Then you simply use  Getopt::Long and PodUsage.

    - In addition to getting a usage message, you get a man page (based on
      pod2man) and your application is CPAN-ready.

    - As a result, you have a decent level of control over the look of the
      usage and help text. To the extent that you can't control appearance, at
      least your documentation looks standard.

    - When you invoke pod2usage, you can specify a verbosity level, which
      controls the POD sections that are rendered.

    - The main drawback is POD itself.

    - You could wrap the module to simplify usage further: trap the WARN from
      GetOptions and invoke your own help(); then invoke pod2usage if --help or
      --man are requested.

MooseX::GetOpt

    - Front end for Geopt::Long
    - Requires using Moose
    - Not many new ideas here

Python plac module

    - This module wraps argparse.

    - It deduces the needed parser based on: the signature of the main()
      function (for positional arguments); annotations of the main() function
      (for options).

    - Advertises itself as being super easy to use and setup, but by the time
      you create all of the awkward-looking annotations, it seems like argparse
      would have been simpler.

Ruby Trollop

    - Very simple to use

    - Not much customizability.

Python argparse module

    - Important concept: the module should parse/validate arguments or options

Python's docopt:

    - Primary ideas: (1) write good usage text and build opt parser from it.
      and (2) parsing should be separate from validation.

    - Tried to use it, but seems half-baked:

        - The parsing code is up to the task of achieving goal of infering
          complex logic and arg/option interdependencies from a usage text).

        - It's easy to cause their demo example (misc/examples/naval-fate) to
          fail just be making a few obvious changes to the configuration.

    - There is a fundamental problem with separating arg parsing from data
      validation. Because docopt does not validate, it lacks the concept like
      argparse's `choices`. As a result, a library focused on giving the user
      clear usage text has no mechanism for telling the user what the allowed
      values are for an option-argument.

    - The library also has an awkward way of creating the returned opts
      dictionary, with keys like `--foo` and `<path>`.

    - The library's returned dict also divorces an option's presence (a
      True/False flag) from the value of its argument. For example, a spec like
      `-C PATH` would produce a dict like `{'-C': True, 'PATH', '/tmp/blah'}`.
      That seems like a fundamental problem.

Python: Click

    - Interesting but opinionated

    - Explicitly rejects customizability of help output

    - Option parsing configuration ends up spread widely across your code base,
      next to the actual functions that do the work, rather than centralized

    - Is lazily composable

    - Follows the Unix command line conventions

    - Supports loading values from environment variables

    - Supports for prompting of custom values

    - Nestable and composable

    - Supports file handling

    - Useful helpers: getting terminal dimensions; ANSI colors; fetching direct
      keyboard input; screen clearing; finding config paths; launching apps and
      editors.

Python invoke:

    - Part of the Fabric ecosystem.

    - Good for a collection of small tools used by a project.

    - Not a full CLI arg parser.

Ruby Thor

    - Similar to Fabric in its approach.

    Wants to customize help text capitalization to mimic standard English usage
    for section titles. The answers demostrate the absurdity of trying to
    customize argparse help text.

        Usage: ...                       # Difficult: must subclass.

        Positional arguments:            # Fairly easy: ap._positionals.title
            ...

        Optional arguments:              # Fairly easy: ap._optionals.title
            ...

        frob -y -z [other-opts]

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4466197

    Grammar needed:

        frob [ -s | -f [-m] ] <host>
        frob -h

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28660992

    Grammar needed:

        - Option takes 2 args.
            - The 1st arg must be A|B|C.
            - The 2nd arg must be X|Y|Z.

        frob [-a {A,B,C} {X,Y,Z}]
        frob -h

    Solvable if the parser allows `choices` to take a list:

        dict(
            option = '-a',
            nargs = 2,
            choices = [(A, B, C), (X, Y, Z)],
        )

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25626109

    Grammar needed: if -x if present, -a and -b are also required.

        frob          [-y] [-z]
        frob -x -a -b [-y] [-z]

http://bugs.python.org/issue11588

    Grammar needed:

        - Sets of arguments that must occur together.

        frob -o           [-x]
        frob -r (-p | -s) [-x]

    Grammar needed:

        frob -a -b [-x]

http://bugs.python.org/issue10984

    Grammar needed:

        - User has three flags: -a -b -c
        - Plus some other flags: -x -y
        - The -b flag is incompatible with both -a and -c.

    Grammar needed:

        frob [-x] [-y] (<a> <b> <c>)...

    Approach:

        - Allow groups of positionals to be repeated, with append-like action.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19114652

    Grammar needed:

        - The entire CLI grammar can be repeated.

        frob (version <n> --file <p1> <p2>)...

    Control how choices are listed in usage text:

        - eg, don't repeat them.

            -n {foo,bar,baz}, --name {foo,bar,baz}

        - or refer to them by name, and then define the name later

            --othername FOO

            where FOO
                foo
                bar
                baz

Help text with subparsers:

    frob -h
        - some people want just top-level help
        - others want all help : top-level all subparsers

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4042452

    If program has required args/options, but it is run
    with zero args, provide help text, not error text.

    It's trivial if you have a grammar:

        frob <x> <y> [-z]
        frob --help
        frob

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27258173

    - Required: -x, -y, or both (but not neither).

    frob -x [-y] [-z]
    frob -y [-x] [-z]

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5257403

    - wants nargs to allow a range: eg, 1 to 3.

    - this works, but starts to look ugly if N gets larger

        frob -x A [B [C]]

        frob -x A [B [C [D [E [F]]]]]

    - other possibilities:

        frob -x A...{7}
        frob -x A...{1,3}
        frob -x A...{0,3}
        frob -x A...{3,}

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4692556

    Need just the literal 'all' or 1+ positions.

    frob [-x] [-y] all
    frob [-x] [-y] <pos>...

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62524681

    - Wants a grammar where each -C option resets the configuration,
      and where the specifically declared configurations are linked
      to the -p option.

    - The desired end result is a list of configurations.

    frob -w 100 -c 50 -C -w 1000 -c 500 -p /foo -C -w 5% -c 3% -p /bar
         ----(3)-----    ---------(1)----------    --------(2)--------

    1. Configuration for the /foo volume.
    2. Ditto, for /bar volume.
    3. Configuration settings for all other volumes.

job-client:

    Allow for extra options for job-client devs, based on env var.

    Special options that exit-with-msg (without griping about other issues):
        --version
        --examples
        --autocomplete

    General and task-specific help (without griping about other issues):
        job-client -h
        job-client TASK -h
        job-client -h TASK -h

    Using a YAML config file:

        - Settings from the config file should control the `default`
          settings for the argument parser.

        - When running `job-client configure`, you do not want to load the
          existing config file.

Example 1:

    [-b]      [-x] [-y]   # -a and -b are mutex,
    [-a] [-c] [-x] [-y]   # and -b also allows -c

Example 2:

    [-x]  [-z] <a>
    -y -x [-z] <a> [<b>]   # If -y, then -x is required and <b> is allowed.

Example 3:

    [-x] [-y] (<a> <b> <c>)...

Example 4:

    (-x | -y | -z -q) [-a] <b>
