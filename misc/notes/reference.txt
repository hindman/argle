Given a grammar, generate an appropriate parser.

Given input text, use a lexer to generate typed tokens.

Feed the tokens into the parsers, which determines validity and returns a

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1410477/what-is-packrat-parsing

Many parsers use context-free grammars (CFG). For example:

    E -> E * E | E + E | (E) | N
    N -> D | DN
    D -> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

    Rule 1: nonterminal E can be replaced E * E, etc.
    Rule 2: nonterminal N can be replaced by D or DN.
    Rule 3: nonterminal D can be replaced by any single digit.

    The rules can generate any simple arithmetic expression using +, *, parens,
    and single digits.

CFGs are a compact way to represent a collection of strings and they have a
rich and well-understood theory. However, they have two main drawbacks.

    - A CFG defines a collection of strings, but doesn't tell you how to check
      check a string for validity. This means that whether a particular CFG
      will lend itself to a nice parser depends on the particulars of how the
      parser works, meaning that the grammar author may need to familiarize
      themselves with the internal workings of their parser generator to
      understand what restrictions are placed on the sorts of grammar
      structures can arise.

    - Grammars can be ambiguous. For example, the above grammar generates the
      string 2 + 3 * 4, but does so in two ways. In one way, we essentially get
      the grouping 2 + (3 * 4), which is what's intended. The other one gives
      us (2 + 3) * 4, which is not what's meant. This means that grammar
      authors either need to ensure that the grammar is unambiguous or need to
      introduce precedence declarations auxiliary to the grammar to tell the
      parser how to resolve the conflicts. This can be a bit of a hassle.

Parsing expression grammars (PEG) are alternatives to CFGs. Here's the same
arithmetic example in PEG form:

    E -> F + E | F
    F -> T * F | T
    T -> D* | (E)
    D -> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 / 9

A key feature of PEGs is explicit ordering of parsing alternatives. The syntax
can be read as "First try this, then this, etc". In that sense, PEGs directly
encode into the grammar structure itself how the parsing is to be done. This
approach resolves the ambiguity noted above and lends itself toward direct
translation from grammar to parser generation.

The Packrat Parsing Algorithm builds on the PEG approach. The algorithm is
conceptually quite simple. At a high level, a packrat parser begins with the
start symbol, then tries the ordered choices, one at a time, in sequence until
it finds one that works. As it works through those choices, it may find that it
needs to match another nonterminal, in which case it recursively tries matching
that nonterminal on the rest of the string. If a particular choice fails, the
parser backtracks and then tries the next production.

The algorithm combines the PEG approach with memoization (essentially dynamic
programming without the bookkeeping) to achieve linear performance.

TODO: these notes need rework, edting

why CLI grammar is not directly amenable to PEG, recursive descent, etc. It is
a context-sensitive language. Read this and take notes:

    https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/170902/why-cant-we-use-memoization-to-parse-unambiguous-context-free-grammars-in-linea

An important detail here is that grammars do not accept strings; they generate
strings. Grammars are descriptions of languages that provide a means for
generating all possible strings contained in the language. In order to tell if
a particular string is contained in the language, you would use a recognizer,
some sort of automaton that processes a given string and says "yes" or "no."

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy


    Type 0: Recursively enumberable

        Automaton: Turing machine

        Production rules allowed:

            
    Type 1: Context-sensitive
    Type 2: Context-free
    Type 3: Regular

Grammars that are context-free (or that plus being regular), can be expressed
with static substitution rules:

    NOUN     : BlueBomber | Grijesh | I | We
    TENSE    : am | was | is | were
    VERB     : going | eating | working
    SENTENCE : <NOUN> <TENSE> <VERB>

Superficially, the grammar seems alright, but it can also generate sentences
that English speakers would reject due to subject-verb disagreements.


Regular grammar:

    Languages generated by regular grammars can be parsed by finite state
    automata, where what you can accept at one state does not depend on
    anything except the state that you're currently in.

    Notation:
        A : terminal
        x : non-terminal

    A : x B
    A : x

    An example:

        # Any number of a, followed by any number of b.
        a{m} b{n}

        W : a W
        W : b W
        W : a
        W : b

Context-free grammar:

    Context-free languages can be accepted by pushdown automata, which are
    finite state automata equipped with a stack for memory. This allows the
    automaton to remember what has already been seen.

    An example:

        # Same number of a and b.
        a{n} b{n}

    A : a
    A : a A
    B : b B
    B : b

App::Cmd

    - Conclusion: not sure that I'm sold on this.

    - The documentation is difficult.

    - The module uses Params::Validate and Getopt::Long::Descriptive, and it
      does not appear to be flexible in that regard.

Getopt::Long::Descriptive

    - Front end for Getopt::Long

    - Promising in several respects.

    - One could write a subclass to modify help text output.

    - But it does not support the basic element of a option arg name (eg
      --logfile PATH)

    - So subclassing will take you only so far.

    - Supports concept of "implies": if -X, then -Y and -Z are required.

    - Support concept of a hidden option (not in help text).

Getopt::Tabular

    - Tabular spec definition

    - Validation

    - Help text: not bad, but not controllable

    - Can parse an array besides ARGV

    - Looks unmaintained.

Getopt::Lucid:

    - Interesting approach

    - Emphasizes readability of specification

    - Uses a chainable module when defining specs

    - Also allows you to merge options with config

    - Does not produce help text

Getopt::Euclid

    - Creates parser from your application's POD, specifically:

    - The POD can also include validation assertions.

    - Still active.

    - Takes input from @ARGV and puts results in %ARGV

    - I don't like the fact that it uses globals and is non-OO

Getopt::Simple

    - Wrapper around Getopt::Long

    - Produces help text.

Getopt::Declare

    - Builds option parser from a help-text string

    - It's an interesting idea.

    - Requires a special syntax to define the spec and that syntax is embedded
      in the help string

    - Abridged

    - Base
    - Chain

    - Tiny
    - Usaginator
    - Params::Validate
    - Params::Smart
    - Getargs::Mixed
    - Getargs::Long
    - Pod::WikiDoc

Pod::Usage

    - You document your application with POD.

    - Then you simply use  Getopt::Long and PodUsage.

    - In addition to getting a usage message, you get a man page (based on
      pod2man) and your application is CPAN-ready.

    - As a result, you have a decent level of control over the look of the
      usage and help text. To the extent that you can't control appearance, at
      least your documentation looks standard.

    - When you invoke pod2usage, you can specify a verbosity level, which
      controls the POD sections that are rendered.

    - The main drawback is POD itself.

    - You could wrap the module to simplify usage further: trap the WARN from
      GetOptions and invoke your own help(); then invoke pod2usage if --help or
      --man are requested.

MooseX::GetOpt

    - Front end for Geopt::Long
    - Requires using Moose
    - Not many new ideas here

Python plac module

    - This module wraps argparse.

    - It deduces the needed parser based on: the signature of the main()
      function (for positional arguments); annotations of the main() function
      (for options).

    - Advertises itself as being super easy to use and setup, but by the time
      you create all of the awkward-looking annotations, it seems like argparse
      would have been simpler.

Ruby Trollop

    - Very simple to use

    - Not much customizability.

Python argparse module

    - Important concept: the module should parse/validate arguments or options

Python's docopt:

    - Primary ideas: (1) write good usage text and build opt parser from it.
      and (2) parsing should be separate from validation.

    - Tried to use it, but seems half-baked:

        - The parsing code is up to the task of achieving goal of infering
          complex logic and arg/option interdependencies from a usage text).

        - It's easy to cause their demo example (misc/examples/naval-fate) to
          fail just be making a few obvious changes to the configuration.

    - There is a fundamental problem with separating arg parsing from data
      validation. Because docopt does not validate, it lacks the concept like
      argparse's `choices`. As a result, a library focused on giving the user
      clear usage text has no mechanism for telling the user what the allowed
      values are for an option-argument.

    - The library also has an awkward way of creating the returned opts
      dictionary, with keys like `--foo` and `<path>`.

    - The library's returned dict also divorces an option's presence (a
      True/False flag) from the value of its argument. For example, a spec like
      `-C PATH` would produce a dict like `{'-C': True, 'PATH', '/tmp/blah'}`.
      That seems like a fundamental problem.

Python: Click

    - Interesting but opinionated

    - Explicitly rejects customizability of help output

    - Option parsing configuration ends up spread widely across your code base,
      next to the actual functions that do the work, rather than centralized

    - Is lazily composable

    - Follows the Unix command line conventions

    - Supports loading values from environment variables

    - Supports for prompting of custom values

    - Nestable and composable

    - Supports file handling

    - Useful helpers: getting terminal dimensions; ANSI colors; fetching direct
      keyboard input; screen clearing; finding config paths; launching apps and
      editors.

Python invoke:

    - Part of the Fabric ecosystem.

    - Good for a collection of small tools used by a project.

    - Not a full CLI arg parser.

Ruby Thor

    - Similar to Fabric in its approach.
