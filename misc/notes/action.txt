Nail down naming, classes, attributes, API, and general terminology.

Grammar data structure: specify with greater clarity.

Wrap up editing:
    - specification.txt
    - action.txt

Rename project: optopus:
    x Package and module name.
    x Notes files.
    - Git repo: remote and local.
    - Set up virtualenvs.

Drop PY2 support.

MVP: zero-config parsing.

Publish first beta version.

Parsing backed by core grammar.

Usage text creation.

High precendence.

Dispatch support.

Anchored Opts.

Conveniences.

Integration with config data and env variables.

--------
feature-list: Feature list
--------

Support zones and anchors to regulate argument ordering (via the API, not grammar syntax).

Support high-precendence options.

Need to support other formats (eg, POD or man pages).

Maybe support the tool's usages for simple conversion/validation of arguments
to functions.

Ability to emit parser config as data.

Support variant validation hooks.

Support sub-variants.

Support abbrev not only for long-options but also choices.

- Drop the Simple spec: just have a grammar and allow it to parse in full (with
  variants), in basic usage (standard command line grammar), and for an
  individual option.

- Don't worry about using simple dependencies: attrs, short_con.

- tox: py27 tests fail under tox (they pass under development virtualenv).

- Implement a proof-of-concept for the new parsing approach:

- asserts in code: don't rely on them for error checking

- GrammarSpecParser and complex Phrase parsing.
  - Planning.
  - Basic GrammarSpecParser implementation.
  - Complex grammars:
    - Varying nargs and ntimes.
    - Keeping track of partially-parsed results.
    - Pruning no-longer-eligible subphrases.
    - Keeping track of alternatives.
    - Backtracking using those alternatives.

- Support high-precendence.

- Check argparse for other behaviors.

- Handle --opt=val.

- Constructors should support dict-based configuration. Parser does, but not
  FormatterConfig and Section.

- help_text(): usage section: when wrapping, keep options together with their
  option args.

- Wildcards mode: allow user to specify pos/opt/both/True.

- nargs and ntimes: support regex-style quantifiers, both in specs and in the
  generated USAGE help-text.

- Negatable options: `--smart-case` and `--no-smart-case`.

- API thematic configuration.

- Help text customization.

- Support allow_abbreviation boolean.

- Option customization: eg, the regex to identify long opt, short opt, etc.

- Better exception strategy.

- Man-page support.

- Integration with configuration files.

- Integration with ENV variables.

- Support no-args behaviors, such as show-help or default-args.

- Support global configuration to automatically add single-letter aliases.
