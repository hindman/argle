Repo is a command line tool that showcases how to build complex command line
interfaces with Argle.

This tool is supposed to look like a distributed version control system to
show how something like this can be structured.
```

Commands :::
    <command=clone>   : Clones a repository
    <command=commit>  : Commits outstanding changes
    <command=copy>    : Copies files
    <command=delete>  : Deletes a repository
    <command=setuser> : Sets the user credentials

General options :::
    [--repo-home <path>]        : Changes the repository folder location
    [--config <key> <value>]... : Overrides a config key/value pair [repeatable]
    [-v --verbose]              : Enables verbose mode
    [--version]
    [--help]

Command: clone ::

```
This will clone the repository at <src> into the folder <dst>. If <dst> is not
provided this will automatically use the last path component of <src> and create
that folder.
```

    <src>               : Repository source
    [<dst>]             : Directory path in which to put the cloned repo
    [--deep]            : Deep checkout [the default]
    [--shallow]         : Shallow checkout
    [-r --rev <commit>] : Clone a specific revision instead of HEAD

Command: commit ::

```
Commits outstanding changes.

Commit changes to the given files into the repository. You will need to
"repo push" to push up your changes to other repositories.

If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by "repo status" will be
committed.
```

    [<file>]...              : File path
    [-m --message <text>]... : Commit message [if multiple, joined by newline]

Command: copy ::

```
Copies one or multiple files to a new location. This copies all files from
<src> to <dst>.
```

    [<src>]... : File path
    <dst>      : Directory path of destination
    [--force]  : Forcibly copy over an existing file

Command: delete ::

```
Deletes a repository.

This will throw away the current repository.
```

    [--yes] : Confirm the action without prompting

Command: setuser ::

```
Sets the user credentials.

This will override the current user config.
```

    [--username <user>] : Username
    [--email <address>] : Email address
    [--password <pw>]   : Login password
